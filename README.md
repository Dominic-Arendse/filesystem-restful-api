# Filesystem RESTful API
The Filesystem RESTful API is a Java-based Web Service built with Jersey (2.2) allowing you to expose a RESTful interface for interactacting with your filesystem.

**Setup Your Environment**

This project is built with Eclipse IDE Mars Release (4.5.0) and Jersey (2.2).
All that is required for you to get your environment up and running is as follows:
1.  Clone the repository into a location of your choice.
2.  Open the project in Eclipse IDE or any other IDE of your choice.
3.  Export a `WAR` file to your `tomcat` (and/or equivalent open-source Java Servlet Container) `webapps` directory.

**Building/Compiling The Project**

There consists various ways to setup this web service (i.e. actual web server setup), but to keep things simple all that is required to build this application is to run `tomcat` or equivalent, this will deploy the app.

Once the command has been executed successfully, a URL will be generated that you can visit (i.e. `Laravel development server started: <http://127.0.0.1:8000>`) to see the application in action.
